1.WAP to calculate norm and trace of matrix.
2.WAP to find maximum and minumun value in an given array of n elements.
3.WAP to check whether given string is palindrome or not. A palindrom word is
sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam
or racecar.You can use strcmp() function to compare 2 strings.
4.Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 20
and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is
higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high,
try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the
program should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a
loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
Display score after user enters correct number.Total score is 20.And
score deduced by one each time user enter wrong guess.
You can use this code to generate random number.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<time.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() 
{
int num;
srand(time(0)); /* seed random number generator .Use current time as seed for
random generator*/
num = rand() % 20 + 1; /* random number between 1 and 20 */
printf("%d",num);//value of num vary every time you run the program
}
If random numbers are generated with rand() without first calling srand(),
your program will create the same sequence of numbers each time it runs.

Guess the number GAME.
Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of difficulty. The first level of difficulty would be a
number between 1 and 10. The second difficulty set would be between 1 and 100. The third difficulty
set would be between 1 and 1000. Prompt for the difficulty level, and then start the game. The
computer picks a random number in that range and prompts the player to guess that number. Each time
the player guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to whether the number is too high or
too low. The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses. Once the player guesses the
correct number, the computer should present the number of guesses and ask if the player would like to
play again. 
Example Output
Let's play Guess the Number. Pick a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3): 1
I have my number. What's your guess? 1
Too low. Guess again: 5 
Too high. Guess again: 2
You got it in 3 guesses!
Play again? N
Goodbye! 
Constraints
• Don’t allow any non-numeric data entry.
• During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong guesses.
Challenges
• Map the number of guesses taken to comments:
– 1 guess: “You’re a mind reader!”
– 2–4 guesses: “Most impressive.”
– 3–6 guesses: “You can do better than that.”
– 7 or more guesses: “Better luck next time.”
